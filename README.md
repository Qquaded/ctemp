# Construct – Modding Terms of Service

**Effective Date:** {set on publish}

**Overview:** These terms explain how players and developers can create and use third‑party modifications ("Mods") for **Construct**. Mods are welcome if they are safe, respectful of intellectual property, aligned with Roblox policies, and in support of a fair experience for all players. By developing or distributing a Mod, you agree to these rules.

---
## 1) Key Terms

* **Game**: *Construct* and its related code, assets, and services.
* **Mod**: Any content that alters, adds to, or otherwise interfaces with the Game (e.g., code, art, UI, data packs).
* **SDK/API**: Official tools and documentation that have been published for modding.
* **We/Us**: The Construct development team.
* **You**: Any individual making, distributing, or using Mods.

## 2) Agreement

By developing, publishing, or distributing a Mod, you agree to comply with this Modding TOS. If you do not agree, do not develop or distribute Mods.

## 3) Roblox Platform Rules

Because Construct is on Roblox, all Roblox Terms of Use, Community Standards, and UGC/Developer policies apply. In the event of a conflict, the more limiting rule applies.

## 4) License to Use SDK/API

We grant you a limited, revocable license to use the SDK/API to develop Mods for the Game. You may not:

* Reverse engineer private code or content.
* Bypass security or anti‑cheat systems.
* Use exploits, executors, or injectors.
* Harm the Game's services or other players' experiences.

## 5) Intellectual Property

* **Your Rights**: You own what you create in your Mod, except for our property, Roblox property, or third‑party content that you do not have permission to use.
* **License to Us**: You grant us the right to host, analyze, combine, and distribute your Mod so that it will function in the Game. This license is royalty‑free and worldwide.

## 6) Third‑Party Content

If you utilize code, libraries, or assets from outside sources, you must have the legal right to do so and provide any required credit. Do not incorporate copyrighted or unlicensed materials.

## 7) What Mods May Not Contain

Mods may not:

* Enable cheating, automation, or unfair advantages.
* Include viruses, malware, or stealthy data gathering.
* Promote harassment, hate, self‑harm, or illegal activity.
* Utilize bugs to shatter or crash the Game.
* Reveal private or non‑public information.

## 8) Data and Privacy

* Mods may only read data the SDK/API allows.
* No secret tracking, keylogging, or harvesting of private information.
* If your Mod collects usage data, make it obvious.

## 9) Security and Stability

* Keep Mods exploit-free and free of secrets like API keys.
* Report exploits privately to us.
* Mods should fail safely without corrupting saves or crashing the Game.

## 10) Distribution and Monetization

* **Distribution**: Mods can only be distributed through official or approved channels (such as an in‑game mod browser or Roblox‑compliant repositories).
* **Monetization**: Only with our permission. Mods cannot add gambling mechanics or pay‑to‑win advantages.
Bug fixes and security updates must be free.

## 11) Updates and Compatibility

We can patch the Game or SDK at any time. Mods may break, and you need to update them. Mods should not interfere with or replace other Mods.

## 12) Removal and Appeals

We can disable or take down Mods at any time for any reason, such as safety, performance, or legal concerns. You may appeal takedowns, but may not re‑upload substantially similar content pending review.

## 13) Disclaimer

Mods are provided "as is." We don't guarantee that Mods will always work, be safe, or remain compatible.

## 14) Limitation of Liability

We're not liable for damages caused by Mods. If we're found liable, it won't exceed any fees you directly paid to us for modding access.

## 15) Indemnification

You'll indemnify us for any claim or expense that results from your Mod, your use, or your violation of these terms.

## 16) Changes

We can modify this Modding TOS at any time. You consent to the new terms if you continue to create or distribute Mods after we make the changes.

## 17) Termination

We can end your modding rights at any time. If we do, you'll have to stop using our SDK/API and distributing affected Mods. Certain provisions (like IP rights and liability) will still apply.

## 18) Contact

* **General Questions**: {email or Roblox contact form}
* **Removal/DMCA Requests**: {email or link}

## 19) Community Rule

This isn't a legal contract. It's a community rule set to make modding safe, fair, and fun. By modding, you're promising to follow these rules in good faith.

## 20) Minors

If you're under the age required by law or Roblox policy, you need to obtain parental or guardian permission to create Mods.
